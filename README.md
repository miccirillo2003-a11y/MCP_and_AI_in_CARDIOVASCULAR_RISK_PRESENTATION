# MCP_andAI_in_CARDIOVASCULAR_RISK_PRESENTATION
This repository contains a project developed for the Programming for Data Science exam within the Master's Degree in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.

The main objective of this project is to provide researchers and medical professionals with an AI-based (Claude) decision support tool in the field of cardiovascular risk assessment. Cardiovascular diseases represent one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early risk prediction plays a crucial role in prevention, diagnosis, and personalized treatment planning. For this reason, the project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to analyze clinical datasets and extract meaningful patterns that can support clinical decision-making.

The architecture of the project is designed around three Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, which provide modular and scalable services for data processing, model inference, and analytical support. These servers allow users to upload and analyze clinical datasets, compare patient profiles with similar cases, and obtain predictive insights related to cardiovascular risk factors. The modular design improves system flexibility, enabling easy integration of new datasets, models, or analytical functionalities.

From a technical perspective, the system integrates data preprocessing pipelines (Data ETL), feature engineering, data analysis and a knowledge graph. The tool is designed to assist domain experts by reducing analysis time, improving interpretability of results, and supporting evidence-based decision processes.

Overall, the project demonstrates how artificial intelligence techniques can be effectively applied in healthcare contexts, highlighting the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration between data scientists and medical professionals.
